You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```javascript
var x = "test";
function() {
	console.log(x);
}
```

```scss
	/**
	 * Links
	 */
	a {
	    color: $text-color;
	    text-decoration: none;

	    &:visited {
	        color: darken($brand-color, 15%);
	    }

	    &:hover {
	        color: darken($brand-color, 15%);
	        text-decoration: none;
	    }
	}

	%clearfix {

	    &:after {
	        content: "";
	        display: table;
	        clear: both;
	    }
	}
```
