### Me

Current location: [Melbourne, Australia](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Melbourne+VIC/@-37.971237,144.4926947,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ad646b5d2ba4df7:0x4045675218ccd90!8m2!3d-37.8136276!4d144.9630576).

I am a software developer with a passion for development, efficient agile workflows, great design and powerful, intuitive user experiences. I am excited about big data, data visualisation and analysis, and love designing and implementing empowering tools that give users unprecedented access and insight into whole new worlds of data.

I have been delivering and maintaining responsive, dynamic websites and web applications both in team and solo environments using the latest front end technologies and frameworks since 2013.

I am passionate about innovation and new technology, and am excited about shaping the future of UI and UX in IOT, wearable tech, virtual and augmented reality.

I am currently working full time as part of a professional team of designers and developers in the digital space, and working part time on my own software solutions.

### The blog

This blog will contain notes, learnings, debriefs and opinions on the things I learn and work on, and hopefully should provide a small window into the topics and areas I have interest in, particularly related to development and tinkering with things.
