I am developer with a background in web, game development and a little bit of IOT. I currently work full-time as a developer in [Melbourne, Australia](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Melbourne+VIC/@-37.971237,144.4926947,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ad646b5d2ba4df7:0x4045675218ccd90!8m2!3d-37.8136276!4d144.9630576).

I am particularly interested in applications that deal with interesting data, transforming or analysing it in new and useful ways.

This blog will contain notes, learnings, debriefs and opinions on the things I learn and work on, and hopefully should provide a small window into the topics and areas I have interest in, particularly related to development and tinkering with things.
